You can find the complete manual in the doc folder.

In the KIMlib library, there is an ETS (V5) file that contains the KIMaip device to copy and use in your project. The ETS file is the same one used to load the DEMO application used to make the examples contained in the library work. The device present in it must be configured according to the needs of your project:

  - General configurations;
  - Type of communication object (1Bit, 2Bit, 1Byte ... etc ..); 
  - User Parameter preset value.

You can buy KIMaip KNX / EIB shield for your experiment whit Arduino.
